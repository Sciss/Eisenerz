## building

Builds with sbt against Scala 2.11 (and some against 2.12). The subprojects are independent sbt projects, found in directories
`accelerate`, `experiments`, `exposure`, `rails`, `zerophase`.

Since the original project happened, some subproject have been lifted to newer Scala versions (compiles, but largely untested):

- `accelerate` : Scala 2.12
